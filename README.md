## 9/5 Working on HW1

* Tried Julia and Python and then switch to Matlab due to the linear algebra stuff.

* Note that some namespace are not valid... like `answer.m` and `try.m`

  

For question 1.3:

Toeplitz matrix
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
a & b & c & d & e\\
f & a & b & c & d\\
g & f & a & b & c\\
h & g & f & a & c\\
i & h & g & f & a
\end{bmatrix}
$$


### Some grammar

The style to write for loop:

```matlab
for i 1:1:10
	do something;
end
```

If:

```matlab
if a == b
	do something;
end
```
