### 3.1

The univariate probability density function $p(d) = c(1 - d)$ is defined on the interval $0 \le d \le 1$.

(A) What must the constant, $c$, be for the probability density function to be properly normalized? 

(B) Calculate the mode, median, and mean of this probability density function analytically.



Answer:

(A) To normalize $p(d)$, we will have 
$$
\int_{0}^{1} p(d) \mathrm{d} d = \int_{0}^{1} c(1 - d)\mathrm{d} d  = 1
\\
c(d-\frac{1}{2}d^2)\vert_{0}^{1}=1
\\
c = 2
$$
Thus, $c = 2$.



(B)

i). The mean value $\mu = \int dp(d) \mathrm{d} d $, with $p(d)=2(1-d)$, we will have
$$
\mu = \int_0^12d(1-d)\mathrm{d} d = \int_0^1(2d-2d^2)\mathrm{d} d = d^2-\frac{2}{3}d^3\vert_0^1=\frac{1}{3}
$$
ii). The median value $m$ should satisfy: $\int_0^m p(d)\mathrm{d} d = \frac{1}{2}$
$$
\int_0^m 2(1-d)\mathrm{d} d =\frac{1}{2}
\\
(2d-d^2)\vert_{0}^{m}=\frac{1}{2}
\\
2m-m^2=\frac{1}{2}
\\
(m-1)^2=\frac{1}{2}
$$
Thus, there are two possible solution for $m$, $m=1\pm\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

with the given condition $0 \le d \le 1$, we will have the median is $m=1-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

iii). The mode $M$ shoud satisfy: $p(M)\ge p(d)$,

The derivative of $p(d)=2(1-p)$ is $p^\prime(d)=-2$, which means the maximum value of the function occur at $d=0$

So, $M=0$



In summary, the mean value is $\frac{1}{3}$, the median value is $1-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, the mode is $0$.

### 3.2

The univariate exponential probability density function is $p(d) = \lambda  \exp(-\lambda d)$ where d is defined on the interval $0 \le d < \infty$. The parameter, $\lambda$, is called the rate parameter. 

(A) Use MatLab to plot shaded column-vectors of this probability density function and to compute its mode, median, mean, and variance, for the cases $\lambda = 5$ and $\lambda = 10$. 

(B) Is it possible to control the mean and variance of this probability density function separately?



Answer:

(A).

The probability density function is $p(d) = \lambda  \exp(-\lambda d)$,

(The arrow axis is drawn by iPad on the Matlab output image)

The raw output: 

```matlab
ans = 

    "when $\lambda$ = 5, mean = 0.200, median = 0.139, variance = 0.040, mode = 0.000"


ans = 

    "when $\lambda$ = 10, mean = 0.100, median = 0.069, variance = 0.010, mode = 0.000"

```

which in summary is

| Î» =      | 5     | 10    |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| Mean     | 0.2   | 0.1   |
| Median   | 0.139 | 0.069 |
| Variance | 0.04  | 0.01  |
| Mode     | 0     | 0     |

### 3.3

Suppose that $p(d)$ is a Normal probability density function with zero mean and unit variance. 

(A) Derive the probability density function of $m =|d|^{1/2} $ , analytically. 

(B) Use MatLab to plot shaded column-vectors of this probability density function and to compute its mode, median, mean, and variance.



Answer: 

(A). $p(m)=p[d(m)]\vert\frac{\partial d}{\partial m}\vert$

As  $p(d)$ is a Normal probability density function with zero mean and unit variance, we have
$$
p(d) = N(0,1)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp{(-\frac{d^2}{2})}
$$
Since $m =|d|^{1/2} $, we can get $|d(m)|=m^2$ and $|\frac{\partial d}{\partial m}|=2m$.
$$
p(m)=\frac{2m}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp{(-\frac{m^4}{2})}
$$
